        "* Grid Size: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.\n",
        "* Players: One human player and one computer player.\n",
        "* Symbols: Players take turns marking symbols (●s or ■s) in empty cells.\n",
        "* Target: The target remains to form a straight line with four of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Rules:\n",
        "* Setup: The game is played on a 4x4 grid (16 cells) where two players take turns marking the cells. One player uses '●', and the other uses '■'.\n",
        "* Gameplay: Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell until one player achieves four of their symbols in a row.\n",
        "* Turns: Players alternate placing their symbol on the board. Once a cell is marked, it cannot be changed.\n",
        "* Winning: The game can be won by getting four of your symbols in a row. This can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n",
        "* Draw: If all cells are filled before either player achieves four in a row, the game is a draw.\n",
        "* Goal: Don't lose - either Win or end up on draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Objectives:\n",
        "  - The primary objective is to form a sequence of four symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does.\n",
        "  - Players aim to strategically place their symbols to either create winning sequences or block their opponent's attempts at achieving a winning sequence.\n",

MCTS introduces unnecessary computational overhead for a game with a small and manageable decision space like Tic Tac Toe.\n",
