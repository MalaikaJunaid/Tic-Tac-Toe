# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe, an enhanced version of the classic game designed to challenge your strategic thinking! This project was developed as a mini-semester project with the aim of exploring advanced AI algorithms in game development.

## Features
- Play on a 4x4 grid for increased complexity and challenge.
- Choose between playing against the computer or another player.
- The computer player utilizes advanced AI algorithms to make intelligent decisions.
- Enjoy a user-friendly interface with clear instructions for seamless gameplay.

## Algorithms Used
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Dynamically explores the game space to make informed decisions, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Minimizes the number of explored nodes to improve search efficiency without compromising decision accuracy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the game by executing the appropriate script.
3. Choose your opponent (computer or another player) and start playing!
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves and enjoy the game.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are highly appreciated! If you have any ideas for improvement or would like to contribute to the codebase, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Together, we can continue to enhance the gaming experience for players worldwide.

## Acknowledgements and Inspiration
This project was inspired by a deep passion for game development and AI algorithms. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Python community and Comsats University Islamabad for providing invaluable resources, tutorials, and tools that have enriched our learning experience.

Special thanks to our project partner, Syeda Aleeza Tahir, for her dedication and collaboration throughout the development process. We are also deeply grateful to Sir Hafiz Syed Ahmed Qasim for his expert guidance and mentorship.
